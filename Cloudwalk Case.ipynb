    "# Dark Souls 3: Knowledge Graph Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a step-by-step process for constructing a knowledge graph from in-game textual data extracted from *Dark Souls III*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dark Souls is known for its indirect, cryptic narrative style. Rather than traditional storytelling, the game's lore is conveyed through item descriptions, character dialogue, and environmental clues. By transforming these scattered pieces into a structured graph, we can reveal hidden connections and support complex reasoning about the game world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used here was extracted from the game files and made available by the [DarkSouls3.TextViewer project](https://github.com/mrexodia/DarkSouls3.TextViewer), which aggregates in-game texts such as item descriptions and NPC dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes:\n",
    "- Data extraction and preparation from the JSON dump\n",
    "- Entity and relationship extraction using language models\n",
    "- Knowledge graph construction using the extracted triples\n",
    "- Graph exploration and insight generation\n",
    "- Graph-based question answering via queries\n"

The most frequent relationship type is is (20 instances), which often reflects identity statements (e.g., \"X is a Y\"). Other common relationships include allows, wield, and has, which encode typical item functionalities or associations such as granting abilities, being wielded by someone, or possessing a certain attribute. Symbolic and descriptive relationships like symbolizes and engraved with appear less frequently but convey rich semantic meaning, potentially useful for higher-level lore interpretation and question-answering."

    "- Entities such as `bleeding`, `chaos demons`, and `the painting` have high in-degree values, suggesting they are frequently mentioned or involved in other items’ descriptions.\n",
    "- On the other hand, entities like `Parry`, `Black Knights`, and `Old Wolf Curved Sword` exhibit high out-degree, indicating they initiate multiple relationships — often describing other concepts or linking to many aspects of the lore.\n",

    "This analysis helps identify central lore concepts versus entities that serve as relationship hubs within the graph structure.\n"

    "To complement the statistical analysis, I generated two visualizations: a histogram of node degrees and a bar chart of the top 10 relationship types.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Node Degree Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram reveals a highly right-skewed distribution. Out of 406 nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **302 nodes** have a degree of 1, meaning they are connected to only one other entity.\n",
    "- **73 nodes** have a degree of 2.\n",
    "- A few nodes have degrees of 3 or 4, and only **two nodes** exceed degree 4 — one with degree 5 and one with degree 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is typical of knowledge graphs, where a small number of entities serve as hubs, while most nodes participate in only one or two relationships. This structural insight reinforces the importance of identifying and interpreting central nodes for downstream tasks such as question-answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Top Relationship Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The bar chart of relationship frequencies highlights the most common semantic links between entities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most frequent predicate is **is** (18 occurrences), often used to denote identity or classification.\n",
    "- Functional and descriptive relations such as **allows**, **wield**, **has**, and **symbolizes** are also common.\n",
    "- Less frequent but semantically rich relations like **engraved with** and **offer** contribute to the graph's narrative depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights provide a clearer view of the underlying structure of the Dark Souls lore graph and help prioritize paths for exploration and question-answering."

    "From the graph, 44 distinct relationships tied to shields were found, revealing a wide spectrum of meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combat Mechanics & Functionality**  \n",
    "  Shields often interact with game mechanics directly:  \n",
    "  - `allows` — some shields enable the use of right-hand weapon skills when equipped in the left hand.  \n",
    "  - `make` — e.g., small shields *make ideal instruments for parrying*.  \n",
    "  - `offer` — describe strengths like *high magic absorption* or *little damage absorption*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lore & Affiliation**  \n",
    "  Several shields are tied to factions or figures:  \n",
    "  - `belongs_to` — *Sunset Shield* belongs to the Holy Knights of the Sunless Realms.  \n",
    "  - `associated_with` — *Poison Black Iron Greatshield* is associated with *Knightslayer Tsorig*.  \n",
    "  - `crafted_by` — *Blood Llewellyn Shield* was crafted by a *great smith*.  \n",
    "  - `was_used_by` — the *Chaos Sunlight Shield* was used by an *old Knight of Sunlight*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aesthetic & Symbolic Details**  \n",
    "  Many shields have visual or thematic decorations:  \n",
    "  - `engraved_with` — e.g., *dragon crest*, *sacred tree*, or *crest of a sacred order*.  \n",
    "  - `is_decorated_with` — like a *two-headed dragon* or a *holy sun symbol*.  \n",
    "  - `bears` — physical features like a *double-bladed axe*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Material, Elemental, and Physical Traits**  \n",
    "  Shields encode qualities like:  \n",
    "  - `fashioned_from` — *rare geisteel*.  \n",
    "  - `greatly_reduces` — *magic* or *fire damage*.  \n",
    "  - `is_resistant_to` — *poison* or *other poisons*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Narrative Commentary & Symbolism**  \n",
    "  Some relationships are unusually rich:  \n",
    "  - `were_made_to_shame` — shields designed to humiliate *weak-willed knights*.  \n",
    "  - `were_subject_to` — those who carried such shields faced *merciless ridicule*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these relationships reveal that shields in *Dark Souls* are not just combat gear. They are narrative artifacts — carrying stories, symbols, and subtle clues that deepen the world-building and thematic coherence of the game."

    "### 3.4.2 Extracting Available Relationship Types\n",
    "\n",
    "During the development of the natural-language QA interface, one of the key challenges was ensuring that the Cypher queries generated by the LLM (GPT-4) were **syntactically valid and aligned with the structure of the knowledge graph**. The graph uses a restricted schema where relationships between entities are labeled with specific types such as `wield`, `is_effective_against`, `belongs_to`, etc. However, by default, an LLM may invent or guess relation types (e.g., `wielded_by`, `related_to`) that do not exist in the dataset—leading to runtime errors or empty query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate this, I extracted the full list of relationship types from the graph and injected it directly into the LLM’s prompt as a constraint. This significantly improved query accuracy, but **some issues persisted**, especially when dealing with ambiguous user inputs or variations in phrasing. Queries would occasionally reference slightly incorrect or non-existent relationships, or include issues like undefined variables (e.g., using `type(r)` without declaring `r`), or filters that were too strict to match any node (e.g., `MATCH (a {id: \"X\"})` instead of a more lenient `CONTAINS` match).\n",

    "#### Fixing unstable results for core questions\n",
    "\n",
    "To stabilize the behavior and reduce API costs, I implemented a hybrid approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Five core questions** identified during exploration were manually associated with pre-validated Cypher queries, based on the exact patterns tested in the notebook.\n",
    "- I also wrote **fixed interpretations** for each of these five questions, inspired by the LLM output style but grounded in the actual graph data.\n",
    "- These queries and interpretations are now hardcoded into the app. When a user selects or types one of the five core questions, **no LLM call is made**—the system skips directly to execution and rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "This change eliminated instability and runtime costs for the most frequent queries, while still allowing full flexibility and LLM assistance for open-ended questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these fixes, there is room for further enhancement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training the LLM on query examples**: Fine-tuning a small model or few-shot prompt with many valid question-query pairs could improve open question performance.\n",
    "- **Intelligent fallback mechanisms**: Before executing a query, the app could test if it returns any results and automatically suggest relaxed filters (e.g., switching from `id =` to `CONTAINS`).\n",
    "- **Semantic query repair**: If a relationship is invalid, the system could suggest the closest valid alternative using fuzzy matching or graph schema inspection.\n",
    "- **Debug feedback for users**: Expose more information about query failures to help users rephrase their question more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of the project highlights the **practical tension between flexibility and reliability** when integrating LLMs with structured data systems—and the value of hybrid solutions for production stability.\n"
